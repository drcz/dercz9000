# work in progress
but not that far from being complete; I need to fix the gamepad sensitivity, and work on levels...

the game is in single file.

requires 2KB of RAM, and ~17.5KB of flash [in case you only have 16KB just remove the logo screen].

![dercz9000 console proud prototype](/img/d9k-prototype.jpg?raw=true "The Prototype")
just plug 4 switches (with 10K resistors) to pins 3,4,5 and 6, plug tvout (no sound right now, don't bother) and it should run.

# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
If it fries your TVset, your arduino, or both, that's neither my responsibility, nor my business.
