# dercz9000
DIY Arduino UNO video console with a game which is neither space invaders nor asteroids

![a screenshot](/screenshots/s0.jpg?raw=true "screenshot 1")

the game is in single file.

requires 2KB of RAM, and ~18.5KB of flash.

Some things still need to be done, in particular more/better levels.

![dercz9000 console proud prototype](/screenshots/d9k-prototype.jpg?raw=true "The Prototype")

just plug 4 switches (with 10K resistors) to pins 3,4,5 and 6,
plug tvout (http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/TVout), and it should run.


# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
If it fries your TVset, your arduino, or both, that's neither my responsibility, nor my business.
