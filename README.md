# dercz9000
DIY Arduino UNO video console with a game which is neither space invaders nor asteroids

# work in progress
(but not that far from being complete, right?)

the game is in single file.

requires 2KB of RAM, and ~17KB of flash [in case you only have 16KB just remove the logo screen].

![dercz9000 console proud prototype](/screenshots/d9k-prototype.jpg?raw=true "The Prototype")

just plug 4 switches (with 10K resistors) to pins 3,4,5 and 6, plug tvout (no sound right now, don't bother) and it should run.

# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
If it fries your TVset, your arduino, or both, that's neither my responsibility, nor my business.
